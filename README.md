# Literally a tutorial Django blog

I'm only doing this for the practice. Check out the [Django Girls Tutorial here](https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/)

## If you'd *really* like to use this, I'll update the information here later.

It's really not too complicated. You only need to have Python3 and Django 2.0.
